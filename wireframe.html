        <h2>WIREFRAME DESIGNS</h2>
        <p>These four images below are wireframes that are designed by individuals in our team. We were assigned to look at Alistair's questionnaire and design a simple mock-up of what the final proto-site would look like.</p>
        <section id="wireframeContainer">
            <div class="crop-container">
                <h3>Yun's Mock-up Design</h3>
                <a href="img/wire1.jpg"><div id="wf1"></div></a>
                <p>What the team really liked about Yun's design is the use of the underlying list for each lecture. The underlying list that Yun proposed clearly shows the user which lecture page they are currently at in terms of a usability design decision.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="crop-container">
                <h3>Danny's Mock-up Design</h3>
                <a href="img/wire2.jpg"><div id="wf2"></div></a>
                <p>The team likes Danny's simple design and the use of the sidebars to provide students a clear section where they can find these information. In the design there are two sidebars, one for lecture agenda and the other is for resources. These sidebar sections have a position:fixed css styling to make it stay at that location when the user is scrolling.</p>
                <p>Also for the lecture agenda sidebar, when a student clicks on a specific topic it will scroll down to the beginning of that section.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="crop-container">
                <h3>Neil's Mock-up Design</h3>
                <a href="img/wire3.png"><div id="wf3"></div></a>
                <p>The team likes Neil's simplicity and his idea of improving upon using a very simplar approach to the current COMP1950 site. Neil reduced the amount of colours to create more white space for the content to be higher in heirarchy for users to read.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="crop-container">
                <h3>Rob's Mock-up Design</h3>
                <a href="img/wire4.jpg"><div id="wf4"></div></a>
                <p>The team likes Rob's use of images for his mock-up. We had a long discussion as to whether to use images for the proto-site. In the end the team decided that we can use images if they are useful in an educative way. We will definitely be using images in the Tumblr blog for the proto-site design which we believe that is the perfect place to implement it.</p>

            <h2>Final Wireframe Design</h2>
            <p>After reviewing all 4 of our mock-ups, we took elements that we agreed with based on the notes above. We took those elements and designed a final wireframe that we will use to design our proto-sites. Here is our team's final wireframe below:</p>
