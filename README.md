OVERVIEW
--------

**[RE]INNOVATE COMP 1950** is our final project for our BCIT course COMP 1950 - Intermediate Web Design and Development. Our objective in our final project is to **redesign the course homepage**. We have our client, Alistair Calder, to provide us with information on what his vision is for the new redesign.

Over the course of two weeks, we will be updating and modifying the content here in this GitHub repository to build our mock-ups. We will be creating wireframes, a sitemap and 3 mockups for 3 sections of the new website *(Home Page, Lecture Page, and Tumblr Blog)*
