<h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
<ul>
<li>SEO ties into both semantics and standards very closely</li>
<li>Long gone are the days of SEO snake oil that saw a lot of shady practices resulting in positive results</li>
<li>Today, most search engine algorithms are so well developed, that the best policy: well marked up content!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are your experiences?</h3>
<p>SEO is a big part of building web sites today - what are your own experiences?</p>

<p><strong>Let's discuss:</strong> </p>
<ul>
	<li>What does SEO mean?</li>
	<li>What are the benefits?</li>
	<li>What does it mean to clients?</li>
	<li>What does it mean for Web Developers?</li>
</ul>    
    

	<h3>Great documents on SEO</h3>
<p>Google's own <a href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/www.google.com/en//webmasters/docs/search-engine-optimization-starter-guide.pdf">Search Engine Optimization</a> guide</p>
<p>The <a href="http://searchengineland.com/download/seotable/SearchEngineLand-Periodic-Table-of-SEO.pdf">Periodic Table of Search Engine Optimization</a></p>

<h3>Highlights</h3>
<p>Here are some of the best practices for proper markup and site design for optimal SEO</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Page Titles</strong> - Encapsulate each page on your site very briefly &amp; include company info </li>
	<li><strong>Titles</strong> are used in results, so be sure they are descriptive and brief</li>
	<li><strong>Meta Description</strong> is used, Meta Keywords are not</li>
	<li><strong>Descriptions</strong> are the content users see in many search engines. Be accurate and descriptive, but be sure to <em>summarize the content on the page</em></li>
</ul>

<h3>Site Structure</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>URL Structure</strong> - Like the previous items, having descriptive URLs is a matter of proper site design</li>
	<li>When URLs make sense, users (and many engines) find it easier to determine the content and the hierarchy</li>
	<li>Use <strong>actual words in URLs</strong> when you can.  /url?ejamcirkanfmnadcmgnskd is not very descriptive.  /products/dogfood/specials is better</li>
	<li><strong>Site structure</strong> plays a big part here</li>
</ul>
	
<h3>Content</h3>
<p>Content within your site is one of the biggest elements that you get ranked on.  Be sure it is accurate and reflects the other elements like Meta Description, Title and any headings.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Content should be easy to read and <strong>on-topic</strong> as much as possible</li>
	<li>Having updated, or <strong>"fresh" content</strong> can improve your site: blog/news/updated info</li>
	<li><strong>Contextual linking</strong> is very important! Descriptive, concise and easy to understand</li>
	<li>Heading tags, as with other logical tags, should be used to <strong>accurately describe content</strong></li>
	<li>Don't use all headings! Opposite effect can happen</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Your viewpoint</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>What is the value of these tools?</li>
		<li>Where do web developers fit in?</li>
		<li>Is this a threat to web development skills?</li>
		<li>Let's <strong>discuss this</strong></li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Discuss on Tumblr</h3>
	<h3>Exercise</h3>
	<h3>This week's assignment</h3>
		<p>Using the principles of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>HTML5 Semantics</li>
			<li>SEO fundamentals</li>
			<li>Solid content</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Build out your page to a site now. Include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A separate page for Sold Listings</li>
			<li>A separate page for Current Listings</li>
			<li>A separate page for Realtor Bio</li>
			<li>Navigation to each page</li>
			<li>New Home page with "fresh" content</li>
			<li>Referer link on every page</li>
		</ul>

		<p>Additionally, you will create a separate page on your Course Site that is a list of all the SEO methods you have used, as well as how you leveraged HTML5 to create the site, so that I can, at a glance, see what you have put into your new Realtor site.</p>
